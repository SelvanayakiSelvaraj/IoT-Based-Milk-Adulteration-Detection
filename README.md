Sustainable IoT-based real-time milk adulteration detection system using AS7265x multispectral sensor ,pH sensor and ESP32.
🥛 IoT-Based Milk Adulteration Detection System
📖 Overview

This project presents a sustainable IoT-based solution for real-time milk adulteration detection using a Multispectral Sensor (AS7265x), pH Sensor, and ESP32 microcontroller. The system analyzes optical and chemical characteristics of milk to detect possible adulteration. It provides fast, portable, and cost-effective monitoring suitable for dairy farms and milk collection centers.

🚨 Problem Statement

Milk adulteration is a serious public health issue. Adulterants such as water, detergent, urea, and starch reduce nutritional value and may cause health risks. Conventional laboratory testing methods are time-consuming, expensive, and not suitable for on-field detection. A real-time, portable monitoring system is required to ensure milk safety and quality.

💡 Proposed Solution

The system integrates:

AS7265x Multispectral Sensor – Captures spectral reflectance data across multiple wavelength bands to detect composition changes.

pH Sensor – Measures acidity/alkalinity variations in milk caused by adulterants.

ESP32 Microcontroller – Collects, processes, and analyzes sensor data.

Blynk IoT Platform – Displays real-time results on a mobile application.

The system compares sensor readings with reference values from pure milk samples to determine adulteration.
